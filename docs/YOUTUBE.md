# Please Reward Me for My Time and Effort!

Every day, I spend between 4 and 10 hours adding new scripts, keeping the existing ones running, and providing support. If you find this project useful, please play your part in keeping it alive and well-maintained.

- [Buying a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/HotWallletBot) costs just $5 and shows your appreciation for the script.
- By making a donation, you help keep the script free to use and regularly maintained.
- If you prefer not to donate, [subscribing on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCygSGwCLIaQAZiYs1lLcRGw) is free, and watching content will count towards monetizing the channel.

The repository is cloned 600 times a week, and if everyone watched just 1 hour, I could get monetized in no time.
